# go-template-api

This project aims to create a structure so that any stream can be generated from JSON. Using this [link](https://go-gen-mma3hhwizq-ue.a.run.app/) it is possible to generate the files to fill the body of this project. The generated files are inserted into the controllers, models, services, and repositories folders.

The routes created are POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE. You only need to copy and paste all code inside your project.

### For example

### Atention ⚠️

The golang Struct generated doesn't contain ID, you should include you.

As the next steps, I will be automating the creation of the query to create the tables in the database.
